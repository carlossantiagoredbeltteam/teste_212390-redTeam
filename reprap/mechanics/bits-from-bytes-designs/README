Lasercut RepRap from Bits from Bytes
====================================

http://www.bitsfrombytes.com/
http://reprap.org

This directory contains the designs done by Bits from Bytes for their lasercut 
RepRap, which Bits from Bytes sell as a kit.

All the lasercutter files are in the directory DXFs-for-laser-cutter.

The parts are tight-packed, with common edges and no gaps.  This means that if
you cut them as they are the laser-cutter will waste a little time cutting some 
lines twice.  Most laser-cutter driver software has an option to edit such lines
so that they are only cut once.

A few parts need to be engraved to get partial-thiknesses.  You will almost certainly
have to experiment with your particular cutter to get those right.

Almost all the parts can be cut in 3mm, 5mm and 8mm acrylic; the file names give
the thickness and material you need.  Two parts are better made in acetal because
they need to be slightly flexible.

Because the shapes are laminar (a few have steps) they can, of course, all also be
made on a RepRap machine.  The STL files for this will be in the directory 
STLs-for-reprapping, though only the extruder is there at the moment; we are
in the preocess of translating the rest.

Some STL files are two or more combined separate laser-cut shapes, as the RepRap
machine can make these in one go, unlike a laser cutter.  Those file names are
combinations of the parts with the word AND in.  Thus:

  bearing-floating-plate-AND-bearing-lower-clamp-plate.stl

is

  bearing-floating-plate.stl   together with   bearing-lower-clamp-plate.stl
