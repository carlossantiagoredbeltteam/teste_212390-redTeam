RepRap

The Replicating Rapid Prototyper Project

These are the files for the PIC that controls the 
RepRap polymer extruder head.

Version 2.  2 November 2005

This software uses SDCC (http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/)

You may need to edit the Makefile to set the right path to the SDCC
library.  The place where this may be needed is commented in the file.

Type "make" to make the file extruder.hex, then download that to the PIC using, 
for example, gpicp (http://home.pacbell.net/theposts/picmicro/).

"make clean" will erase derived files.

If make fails and you need a quick copy of extruder.hex, the original one is
in the directory Saved-hex-file.
