The build process will automatically download and build an appropriate
version of sdcc.  This will take a little while on the first build.

A default build (ie make) will build all devices and tools for the pic16f628

The output is put into the build subdirectory.  A subdirectory will
be created for each output architecture and within that a directory
for each device.


Build options:
PROCESSOR
  Build for a different processor

  eg
  > PROCESSOR=16f627 make

  This will build for the 16f627 rather than the default 16f628

DEVICES
  Build only specific devices

  eg
  > DEVICES=stepmotor make

  This will only build the stepmotor device (no other devices or tools)

Other examples

  > PROCESSOR=16f627 DEVICES=stepmotor make && PROCESSOR=16f628 DEVICES=stepmotorb make

  This will build one controller for the 16f627 and the other for
  a 16f628
