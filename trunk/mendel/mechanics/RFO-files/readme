The files in here are a set of RFO files that can be loaded into the Java Host software 
(see http://objects.reprap.org/wiki/Mendel_User_Manual:_Host_Software) to allow GCodes 
to be generated.  These will make a RepRap Version II "Mendel" print all the reprapped 
parts needed to make another Mendel.

The contents of the trays are listed in the Mendel-m4-assembly-data-sheet.ods spreadsheet 
which is here:
