This directory contains alternative parts to those in the standard Mendel.  Most of these are definite improvements.

frame-vertex-with-foot-4off

This hold the machine higher off the ground giving greater clearance fo moving parts underneath.  This is an alternative to gluing rubber feet on the machine (note - such feet may give better vibration isolation).  Replace four of the six frame vertices with these.

frame-vertex_with_simple_foot_4off.stl

A simple alternative to the above based on the orginal so that the hole sizes are the same.

purge-tray

This is an alternative to the laser-cut projection that catches the purge plastic from the extruder.  It can be made in the RepRap machine, and has indentations to catch the waste.

set-screw-drive-pulley_3off

These Mendel pulleys use an M3 grub screw and a captive nut. The advantage over the original is that you only need one small flat on the motor shaft, rather than two full length ones that have to be filed to exactly the right size.  Replace drive-pulley_3off with three of these.  There are several different pulley designs in the AoI file.  The two main ones are set-screw-drive-pulley_4_6-5_9_7_3off.stl and set-screw-drive-pulley_7_9-5_13_7-3off.stl (the numbers are the parameters into the AoI cog function to generate the profiles).  The first has 9 teeth, the second has 13.  If your electronics can't do microstepping, use the first; this will give you the resolution you need.  If you can do microstepping, use the second; this will give a bigger pulley diameter, putting less strain on the toothed belt.  See the file configuration.h in the firmware for the values to set for steps/mm of movement for each pulley.

xaxis-motorbracket_1off

An alternative motor bracket for the axis.  Removes the need for the x axis spacers, and also the belt follows a smoother path.  If using this reduce the length of the x axis smooth rod to 456mm.

xlr-power-bracket

This part allows you to mount an XLR power connector onto Mendel when you don't have the standard stepper-motor controller carrier board in the machine (for example, if you are using the Pololu electronics: http://reprap.org/wiki/Pololu_Electronics).
