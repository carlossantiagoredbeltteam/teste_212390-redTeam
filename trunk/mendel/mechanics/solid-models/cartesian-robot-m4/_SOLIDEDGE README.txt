Hi!

For your assembly to work, you need to download ALL folders under mendel\mechanics\cartesian-robot\

The General Assembly file is \bot-wedge-m4\general-assembly.asm

Made in SolidEdge v20, Academic licence

Please note that these Solid Edge files are supplied because they may be helpful to some,
but we do not support them.

Enjoy,
