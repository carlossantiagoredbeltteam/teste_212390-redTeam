The Mini-Mendel design is based on M3 Nuts and Bolts, M6 threaded rod, rather than M4s and M8s, giving a much more compact design. The build area is approximately equal to 100 x 100 mm; critically the replication time has been reduced by 66% N.B.  This is experimental and not supported.  The filament feed is also known not to work, and a bowden extruder is required.
