Reprap Host Software README
===========================

Author: Adrian Bowyer, with thanks to Jonathan Marsden, David Goodenough and the RepRap Community 

The RepRap host software runs on your computer, and controls your RepRap machine 
either via a USB port or (old PIC version) a serial port.  It can also run without a RepRap
machine attached and generate G Code files for controlling a RepRap at a later date.

You need a working Java 1.5.0 or later Java Run-time Environment (JRE) to run this 
software. See 

	http://java.com/ 
	
for Java downloads and other information.

This software runs on Linux, Windows, and Macintosh.
