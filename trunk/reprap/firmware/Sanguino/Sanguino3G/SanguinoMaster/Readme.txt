=========================
SANGUINO 3G FIRMWARE v1.2
=========================

This is the v1.2 release of the firmware for Sanguino-based RepRap
motherboards and derivatives.  Right now, this includes:

* RepRap Motherboard v1.1
* RepRap Motherboard v1.2

============
INSTALLATION
============

Complete installation instructions can be found here:
http://www.reprap.org/bin/view/Main/Generation3Firmware

The important points to note are:
* You must have the Sanguino extensions to the Arduino software
properly installed
* Remember to install the libraries
* The RepRap Motherboards v1.1 and v1.2 have a flaw which prevents
them from resetting themselves when the Arduino software tries to
program them.  It's tricky to get the timing right; you may need to
try multiple times.  See the following link for more information:
