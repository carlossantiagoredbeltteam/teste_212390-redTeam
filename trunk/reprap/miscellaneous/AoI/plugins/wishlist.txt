MetaCAD:

- Regular polygon: Unintuitive in quad mode
- online help/tooltips/wizard or smth.?
- Separate object editor (tabs in main dialog)
- Set/compute a minimal size for the dialog
- Have a way of toggling debug inf- on/off (e.g. message boxes)
- Support reading objects created with CSGEvaluator
- error handling
   - Detect missing jogl at startup
   - clean up exception handling
   - some illegal operations fail with a "unit cube" error -> null
     object + error msg
   - Error on missing required parameters (e.g. rotate with < 3
     params)
   - extrude-mesh-native.aoi bug: pop up some error dialog?
   - Use NullObject as error object? color it red?
   - better handling of "dummy"
- caching
- for loop or group as the positive part of a difference -> unintuitive behavior
- Import STL files
- Cleanup curves before inset, mesh, join some curves have duplicate vertices 
  (e.g. polyline-M)
- mesh of mesh -> simplify
- scale doesn't work on vertical/horizontal lines (rect-lines.dxf,
  z-mount.dxf)
- file
   - subdivide arcs in a smarter way (error metric instead of
     fixed # of segments)
   - Inline options or function to decouple from dxf file
