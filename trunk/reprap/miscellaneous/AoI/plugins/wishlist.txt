MetaCADEvaluator:

o Regular polygon: Unintuitive in quad mode
o named parameters: It's hard to remember parameter ordering
o online help/tooltips/wizard or smth.?
o Separate object editor (tabs in main dialog)
o Set/compute a minimal size for the dialog
o Have a way of toggling debug info on/off (e.g. message boxes)
o Parameter evaluation:
  - Read parameters every time a button is pressed which triggers evaluation
    (e.g. union, difference etc.)

o Sometimes the plugin hangs (for a long time)
  for-loop-transform, ring-generator
  -> Missing parameters?
  -> display error on missing params?

o Workflow questions:
  1) Create dummy object
  2) rename to e.g. "poly(reg, 5, 6, 5)"
  3) With GUI, move object away from the origin
  4) evaluate -> object is moved back to the origin.
  -> Should we merge the user-defined origin with our coordsys?
     Merge is hard, but we could replace it?
