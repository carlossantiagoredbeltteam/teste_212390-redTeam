Yes - it's a shame that they didn't stop there, but instead went on to come up with such wrong answers...

No - user interfaces will evolve very quickly when the technology becomes widespread.  And the STL data format (which is technically very poor, but which works) is already an open-standard data format for these machines.

The bottleneck is that all of that industry is wrapped up in its patents, and it spends significant sums jealously fighting for them in the courts.  Companies
are very heavily capitalised (the money was needed for development),
and few - if any - are making profits.  Internally, many 3D printing
machines are not complicated, and the suppliers are using
their patent monopoly to sell them for very high prices to try to
recoup some of that capital.  The cheapest machines cost about
12,000 GBP.

But the patents will soon expire.  When that happens, a really big
fish like Hewlett Packard will move in and start selling machines for -
at a guess - around 1000 GBP.  Private individuals will start buying
them, and the first generation of patent-holding companies will go to
the wall or get bought up.

Then, with luck, RepRap will begin to take off undercutting
everything, and things will start to get really interesting...

Using them needs to become as easy as document preparation and printing are at the moment.  This is clearly technically achievable.  But I suspect most people will not be designing their own objects and devices, any more than they write their own music.  They'll be downloading designs from free and commercial websites so that they can avoid the inefficiency of going out and buying physical objects,  just as they do at the moment with MP3 music files, and soon will be with TV and movies.

We are already entering stage a).  The next two stages will follow in that order.  A lot of entertaining fuss will be made about IP issues.  But it will be strictly entertainment - it has little practical consequence.  To see why, consider the following:

Go up to a stranger in the street and ask them to give you their car,
and you will receive an abrupt reply; go up to a stranger in the
street and ask them to give you their most interesting idea, and half
an hour later you will be glancing at your watch and inventing
fictitious appointments.  And we have all had the experience of coming
up with a neat concept and experiencing the immediately-subsequent
impulse to tell everyone about it - you are a journalist, and so you must be particularly prone to it...

This prompts a profound biological question: if novel information is
such valuable property, what is the Darwinian selective advantage in
the ubiquitous impulse to give it away as soon as we aquire it?

The answer was worked out a few years ago by the evolutionary
psychologist Geoffrey Miller.  He realised that the human mind did not
evolve as a problem-solving device, it evolved - like the peacock's
tail - to waste valuable resources in an un-fakable way as a sign of fitness to potential mates.  The valuable resource being wasted, of course, is blood glucose.

That is why the most important four words in lonely-hearts columns
are Good Sense of Humour, why musicians, painters, authors, and actors (who all do nothing actually useful, but demonstrate great mental agility) are so
attractive to the opposite sex, why accountants, engineers and
computer programmers (who use their intellect for useful and gainful
things) are considered geeky and unattractive, and why we all want to
give away any neat idea as soon as we have it.  These things are what
our brain is for.

If A gives B a material object, A no longer has the object.  But if A
gives B an idea, A still retains the idea.  Information, unlike matter
and energy, is not conserved.  That is why, when teenagers swap MP3
files, they do not instinctively feel that it is theft - nothing is
lost that wasn't a fiction in the first place.

Consequently there is - in reality - no copyright in recorded music
any more, and film and video will soon go the same way.  When anyone
can make any device or machine, the same will happen to the idea of
patents as is happening now to copyright.

The whole concept of intellectual property is only game-theoretically
stable when copying is difficult and legal penalties mean significant
utility-function losses for those who would copy.  Make copying easy,
and the very idea of intellectual property evaporates because the Nash
equilibrium shifts to a point where any legal penalties have nugatory
influence.

But creativity doesn't evaporate with it.  People don't create because
of a rational desire to improve their wealth, they create because they
are driven by an inner compulsion to do so.  And that inner compulsion
is exactly what you'd expect from an evolutionarily-selected mating
trait.

Yes - we have exchanged e-mails, and were due both to take part in a conference in the USA earlier this summer.  Unfortunately, a death in my family at the last minute prevented my going, so I was not able to meet him.  I am going again in October though, so I may get the chance then.

If I can be of any more help, please ask.
