Dear Corresponding Author,

Thank you for your patience as we continue to process submissions to  
the January 2011 Robotica special issue on "Robotic Self-X Systems."   
You have either received, or will very shortly receive, the second  
editorial decision on your contribution.  In this round, two types of  
decisions were issued.

1)  Accept with minor revisions: Your manuscript has been accepted for  
publication in the special issue, pending corrections in accordance  
with reviewer suggestions.  Please take special care to incorporate  
all reviewer comments, and thoroughly proof-read a final version of  
your manuscript.  The image and document/tex source files of this  
final version are to be uploaded by October 15, 2010.  Since your  
manuscript has to be checked prior to final acceptance, we would  
greatly appreciate the upload of these files before October 1, 2010.   
Final acceptance by us then sends your files to the publisher.

2) Revisions required: Reviewers of your manuscript would like to see  
further changes prior to a decision on publication in the special  
issue.  That is, the outcome of a third round of reviews will  
determine whether your manuscript is published in the special issue,  
or deferred to another issue of Robotica.  Please upload your revised  
manuscript no later than September 3, 2010.  You can expect a third  
editorial decision around October 8, 2010.  If your manuscript is  
accepted pending minor revisions at that time, then image and  
document/tex source files of the final version are to be uploaded by  
October 15, 2010.  Your manuscript will be checked shortly thereafter.  
  Final acceptance by us then sends your files to the publisher.

Please note that there is very little flexibility with the above  
deadline dates.  This is because we now have a publisher timeline to  
adhere to.  With the above dates, the first proof of each article will  
be available on November 8, 2010.  Corrections to first proofs are due  
to the publisher on November 15, 2010.  Revised proofs will be issued  
by the publisher on November 23, 2010, with final corrections due on  
November 29, 2010.  All files go to the printer on December 3, 2010,  
in preparation for a January 2011 publication.

Please contact us if you have any questions or concerns.  In addition,  
we ask that you forward this message to your co-authors.

Thank you again for your participation.

With best regards,

Pierre Kabamba
Amor Menezes
