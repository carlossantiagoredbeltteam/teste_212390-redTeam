Dear Dr. Bowyer:

I would like to accept your manuscript entitled "RepRap - The Replicating R=
apid Prototyper" after revision for publication in Robotica.  The comments =
of the reviewer(s) who reviewed your manuscript are included at the foot of=
 this letter.

-------------------
Editor's Comments

The guest editors recommend that this submission be accepted for the specia=
l issue on Robotic Self-X Systems. However, the guest editors expect that t=
he final version of this submission will address the current round of revie=
wer concerns, including the requests of Reviewer 2. =20

Where possible, please make the tone of the paper more formal.  In places i=
t reads more like a press-release than an academic paper.  Please omit figu=
res that are unnecessary or frivolous, in particular Figures 5 and 13.  The=
 sale depicted in Figure 13 certainly deserves mention in the article, but =
the figure is unnecessary, especially since it was featured prominently on =
the RepRap website. =20

Where applicable please make sure information is up-to-date.  For example t=
he map information and estimated number of users should be as recent as pos=
sible.
---------------------

In order to finalize the decision and send your manuscript to production, I=
 kindly ask you to upload your revised manuscript in editable format to our=
 Manuscript Central site. PDF files are not suitable for production, so ple=
ase upload MS Word or LaTex files. Figures should be uploaded separately as=
 high-resolution files.

You will find the manuscript in your author center under "Manuscripts with =
Decisions". Please select "Create Revision", upload your source files and s=
ubmit them online.

PLEASE NOTE: The manuscript will only be officially accepted once you have =
submitted the source files. Any delay will hold up the publication of your =
paper, so please upload the files as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
Prof. Greg Chirikjian
Editor in Chief, Robotica

Comments to the Author
The technical concerns I brought up have been addressed appropriately.

Reviewer: 2
Comments to the Author
This paper appears very similar to the one I reviewed in December 2009.  Pe=
rhaps this is a resubmission of that paper, in corrected form?

If so, I notice that the one factual error I found has not yet been correct=
ed in this version.  Specifically:  on the last line of page 6, =E2=80=9CRe=
producing Concepts Team=E2=80=9D should be corrected to =E2=80=9CReplicatin=
g Systems Concepts Team=E2=80=9D, which was the actual name of the group in=
 this study.

This version also does not appear to respond to the two other simple reques=
ts that I made:

(1) I didn=E2=80=99t see a statement of the estimated lifetime of a typical=
 machine, e.g., how many hours you can get out of key parts, such as a head=
, before it must be replaced.

(2)  I didn=E2=80=99t see a statement of the smallest attainable feature si=
ze (or =E2=80=9Cfeature resolution=E2=80=9D) on product objects that can be=
 fabricated.  As the authors realize, this is different from the raw positi=
oning accuracy, which is stated to be 0.1 mm.

Adding these two bits of information to the text would improve the paper, b=
ut are not critical.

Again, I will note that this is a very excellent review of the kinematic re=
plication field and a fine summary of the history and accomplishments of th=
e RepRap project.  There=E2=80=99s the same exciting feel as in the earlies=
t days in the PC industry back in the late 1970s, when Radio Shack and othe=
rs started selling the first assemble-it-yourself home computers.  I enthus=
iastically recommend this paper for publication in Robotica, after the abov=
e minor matters are properly corrected.
